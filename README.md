 BOARD GAME REVIEW PREDICTION
 
      
In this project, a dataset of about 82000 rows and 20 columns was given regarding the reviews of various board games available. A supervised machine learning model as then been trained and evaluated to predict the ratings given to a particular board game based on several features of the datasets.In order to choose the machine learning algorithms best suited to make predictions of the average rating of the board games, number of regression or similar models were considered and the data has been investigated to choose the best possible model.

Linear Regression and random forest redression is used. 

i) Linear Regression:
Can be chosen if the variables show a linear correlation with the label. If the correlation is not linear, the linear regression model would not be accurate.

ii) Random forest regression:
 regression, the output value of all the trees is averaged; for classification a voting scheme is used to determine the final class. Great at learning complex, highly non-linear relationships.Very easy to interpret and understand. Using larger random forest ensembles to achieve higher performance comes with the drawbacks of being slower and requiring more memory.
